# DivInQUIZ

## Inspiration: 
Most of the communities claim to be inclusive but sometimes they miss out on some small things like greeting the members by saying "Hello Folks" instead of "Hello Guys".

## What it does:
DivInQuiz is a small quiz created to test and aware people on the topic of Inclusivity and Diversity in a different and fun way.

## How we built it:
The tech stack used for building this hack is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into:
The most difficult challenges were to make the quiz questions easy and short which can be answered within 20 seconds.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud that we were able to complete the project within the time-limit. We are happy that we were able to create a quiz which works well completely.

## What we learned
We learned a lot of new concepts in JavaScript.

## What's next for DivInQUIZ
Next we are planning to have the leaderboard as well and you can share the your score and invite others to play the quiz.
